# Customer_Churn_Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., stop using a service). Understanding churn behavior enables businesses to take proactive actions and retain valuable customers.

**Features**<br>
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights<br>

* Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling<br>

* Training and evaluation of five machine learning models<br>

* Comparative analysis of model performance using key classification metrics<br>

* Feature importance and insights for business strategy<br>
<br>
**Dataset**<br>
The dataset includes customer attributes such as:<br>

* **Demographics**: gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents<br>

* **Account Info**: tenure, contract type, billing method, total charges<br>

* **Services**: internet service, streaming services, online security, tech support<br>

* **Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No)<br>

<br>
